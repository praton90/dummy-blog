# dummy-blog
This is React blog created by CRA CLI. This blog contains dummy content fetched from [JsonPlaceHolder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

## Why a dummy blog?
Because I was learning React and I think that the best way to learn something new is to build something real using all the new stuff that you've leardned. So, the focus of this project was to put in practise some basic concepts about React without taking care of the content, by the way, as you can see the blog contains dummy content.
